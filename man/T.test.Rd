\title{Compute the value of t-test between case and control,and find the significant miRNAs in train set}
\usage{
T.test(datacase, datacontrol, dataclass, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{datacase}{A dataframe of expression profile which the samples are case-sample.The list of gene names is the first column of the dataframe.}

\item{datacontrol}{A dataframe of expression profile which the samples are control-sample.The list of gene names is the first column of the dataframe.}

\item{dataclass}{A dataframe with two column.The first column is the list of gene names. The second column is the class of genes after clustering.}

\item{p}{A numeric variable with the threshold value of t-test}
}
\value{
15*count t-test results
}
